# CS-210

  This project was to create a program that output a menu to choose four options from: An itemized list, a quantity of a specific item, a histogram of items bought, or an option to exit. The program took input from a text file of a list of items seperated by line with possible repeats, and in option three, created a data file that had the items unrepeated with a numeric quantity. This program utilized both C++ and Python, and the code to read Python functions was created for me.


-What did you do particularly well?

  For this project I believe I did the Python coding particularly well, and was able to create the menu easily.

-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I could enhance my code to allow different text files to be read, and have the histogram print in a seperate window. This would allow easier input for the user since the text file wouldn't have to be set to specification, and the histogram would be easier to read in a non-cmd window.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The hardest code to write was the histogram, since I wasn't able to figure out how to change the color of the seperate sections, and I sort of overcame this by just making the whole thing a different color. Resources I am adding to my support network will include parts of this program, like the basic menu function, since it seems to work pretty well on its own, until I need to create menus in a standalone environment.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  Skills like how to jump between languages is invaluable and I will have to look into the code I was given to do so. Understanding it and being able to replicate it will come in handy for other projects.

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  This program is maintainable and readable because of the comments left, I hope. It is adaptable because instead of just reading the example text file given to use for testing, I made an input where the program asks for the name of the file to read, so that different names can be used for the file.
